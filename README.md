 A-Comparative-Study-of-Neural-Network-and-Support-Vector-Machine-for-Neurological-Disordered-Voice
 
 A system with Artificial neural network has been developed, where ANN is applied to the time domain features extracted from the voice
 samples. 
 
 The dataset used was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, 
 Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals.
 This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in 
 the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). 
 The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "statusâ€œ column which is set to 0 for
 healthy and 1 for PD.

The algorithm applied on the dataset was neural network with the number of neurons in the hidden layer =30.

The accuracy of the algorithm is 76.27%.
